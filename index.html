    <p class="Introduction">
 I'm Hamza, a passionate and motivated software engineering student currently studying at Vilniaus Kolegija in Lithuania. I began my coding journey with C++, where I developed projects ranging from small games to data management systems, and I'm currently expanding my skills in web development â€” learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.<br>

I love solving problems and building things that are both functional and meaningful. Whether it's backend logic or designing user interfaces, I enjoy every step of the development process. I'm a hard worker with a strong drive to grow as a developer, constantly seeking to improve through practice, self-learning, and hands-on projects.

Aside from coding, I'm highly interested in software architecture, UI/UX principles, and learning how technology can be used to make life easier and more enjoyable.

I'm excited about opportunities where I can apply my skills, collaborate with others, and continue learning in real-world environments.
