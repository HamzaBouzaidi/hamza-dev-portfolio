        <p class="Introduction">
          I'm Hamza, a passionate and motivated software engineering student
          currently studying at Vilniaus Kolegija in Lithuania. I began my
          coding journey with C++, where I developed projects ranging from small
          games to data management systems, and I'm currently expanding my
          skills in web development â€” learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          React.<br />

          I love solving problems and building things that are both functional
          and meaningful. Whether it's backend logic or designing user
          interfaces, I enjoy every step of the development process. I'm a hard
          worker with a strong drive to grow as a developer, constantly seeking
          to improve through practice, self-learning, and hands-on projects.
          Aside from coding, I'm highly interested in software architecture,
          UI/UX principles, and learning how technology can be used to make life
          easier and more enjoyable. I'm excited about opportunities where I can
          apply my skills, collaborate with others, and continue learning in
          real-world environments.
