      <p class="Introduction1">
        I'm Hamza, a passionate and motivated software engineering student
        currently studying at Vilniaus Kolegija in Lithuania. I began my
        coding journey with C++, where I developed projects ranging from small
        games to data management systems, and I'm currently expanding my
        skills in web development — learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        React.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="Introduction2">
        I love solving problems and building things that are both functional
        and meaningful. Whether it's backend logic or designing user
        interfaces, I enjoy every step of the development process.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="Introduction3">
        I'm a hard worker with a strong drive to grow as a developer, constantly seeking
        to improve through practice, self-learning, and hands-on projects.
        Aside from coding, I'm highly interested in software architecture,
        UI/UX principles, and learning how technology can be used to make life
        easier and more enjoyable. I'm excited about opportunities where I can
        apply my skills, collaborate with others, and continue learning in
        real-world environments.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="Introduction4">
        In addition to my diverse experience, I’ve also worked on a range of impactful projects during my academic
        journey, applying both technical and design skills in practical settings.
        I’ve used <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank"
          style="color: rgb(226, 232, 240); text-decoration: none;">Figma</a> extensively to create and evaluate
        interactive prototypes, with a strong focus on usability and user experience—guided by the principles of <a

          style="color: rgb(226, 232, 240); text-decoration: none;">Jakob Nielsen</a>.
        My work demonstrates a solid understanding of design thinking and user-centered design.
        I’ve also explored 3D modeling using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview"
          target="_blank" style="color: rgb(226, 232, 240); text-decoration: none;">AutoCad</a>, gaining hands-on
        experience in translating conceptual ideas into precise technical visuals.

          </div>
          <div style="color: #94A3B8; text-decoration: none;" class="ProjectDescription">
            Collaborated with two teammates to develop a robust console-based Library Management System using C++ and
            the SQLite ORM library.
            The system features dynamic database schema creation with entity relationships between authors, books,
            borrowers, and borrowing records—ensuring data consistency through foreign key constraints, cascade delete,
            and update restrictions.
            We implemented both persistent and in-memory database modes to support real-world usage and unit testing.
            Core functionalities include managing authors, books, and borrowers; tracking borrowing and return
            activities; and generating clean, structured listings with real-time status updates.
            The interface was carefully designed to offer intuitive menu navigation, interactive prompts, and helpful
            error handling, all focused on providing a smooth user experience.
            This project reflects our strong collaboration, clean architecture, and passion for building scalable and
            maintainable systems.

            Snake Game – C++ with SFML 2
          </i>
          <div style="color: #94A3B8; text-decoration: none; flex: 1;" class="ProjectDescription1">
            Developed a modern and engaging twist on the classic Snake game using C++ and the SFML 2 graphics library.
            This solo project focuses on creating a dynamic and replayable experience through random map generation,
            which produces new obstacle layouts each run and stores them via file I/O for persistence.
            The game introduces a coin collection system tied to a functional in-game store, allowing players to shrink
            the snake, buy extra lives, or slow down the game speed—adding layers of strategy and fun.
            Built with CLion, the game balances traditional mechanics with enhanced gameplay, encouraging both quick
            reflexes and tactical decision-making.
            While fully playable, the game remains an evolving project, with future improvements planned. This project
            showcases creativity, problem-solving, and a strong grasp of interactive game development in C++.
